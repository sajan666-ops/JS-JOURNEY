so today i learn about data type ---> [PRIMITIVE & NON-PRIMIVITIVE] and MEMORY[STACK & HEAP]:
DATA TYPE:
//  Primitive

//  7 types : String, Number, Boolearn, null, undefined, Symbol, BigInt

const score = 100 // this is NUMBER
const scoreValue = 100.3 // this a also a NUMBER but in float value. even javascript take both type of number as same INT

const isLoggedIn = false // this is BOOLEAN
const outsideTemp = null // this is NULL
let userEmail; // this is UNDEFINED

const id = Symbol('123') // this is symbol. we'll talk about it later on
const anotherId = Symbol('123')

console.log(id === anotherId); // "===" this equal to sign is used to compare both values and its type

const bigNumber = 3456543576654356754n // this is BIGINT it is used in production code 



// Reference (Non primitive)

// Array, Objects, Functions

const heros = ["shaktiman", "naagraj", "doga"]; // this is ARRAY
let myObj = {     // this is OBJECT
    name: "hitesh", 
    age: 22,
}

const myFunction = function(){ // this is FUNCTION
    console.log("Hello world"); 
}

console.log(typeof anotherId); // by this you can print the type of data on console

// https://262.ecma-international.org/5.1/#sec-11.4.3 
// read the upper value to gain knowlegde in more depth about data and its type.

MEMORY:
all STACK memory take access from PRIMITIVE.
all HEAP memory take access from NON-PRIMITIVE.
