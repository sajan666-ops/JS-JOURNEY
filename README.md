# ⚡️ JS-JOURNEY

**Not a tutorial. Not a playground.** This is the **Mahla Grind Log** — where JavaScript bends, breaks, and gets mastered. One commit per day, every day. No excuses. No breaks.

## 🗂 Structure of the Grind

📁 **Day 1 → Day ∞** Every folder is a timestamp of war. Inside: raw code, experiments, failures, breakthroughs.

- **Day 1** → JavaScript Setup in MAC
- **Day 2** → Let,Const, var 
- **Day 3** → Datatype & Conversions 
- **Day 4** → operations & comparison
- **Day 5** → Stack & Heap
- **Day 6** → Nums/maths & String
- **Day 7** → Date/Time & Array
- **Day 8** → Array advance & Objects
- **Day 9** → objcet construct, destruct & Api talks
- **Day 10** → Functions & Functions with objects and arrays 
- **Day 11** → Scope & Mini Hoisting
- **Day 12** → THIS, Aroow & IIFE
- **Day 13** → Call Stack & Control Flow
- **Day 14** → GOD KNOWS
  
📌 Each day = a brick. At 1000 bricks = fortress. At fortress = Cupertino.

## 🎯 The Mission

- Forge **JavaScript mastery** from scratch.
- Fuse it with **Swift** → the rarest weapon: *Full-Stack iOS Dev*.
- Apply this power to craft 52+ apps → step into **Apple HQ** before 21.

**This is not coding.** This is **becoming god-tier.**

## ⚔️ Tech & Tools

- **JavaScript** → the core language of the web & APIs
- **Node.js** → runtime of backend power
- **GitHub** → the public proof of consistency
- **Xcode + Swift (parallel)** → the iOS throne

## 🔥 Oath

> "Every single commit is blood in the log. Every line of code is one second closer to the dream. This repo isn't about learning JS. It's about **Mahla vs The World.**"

## 📊 Streak Proof


⚡ **Next up** → **Objects, JSON, APIs**. Stay tuned. The grind is **24/7**.
