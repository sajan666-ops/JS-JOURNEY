// so lemme show you how to do dataypes conversion in javascript. 
// so we'll assign the value to with any data 



/*  CONVERTING THE NUMBER/INTERGER TO STRING */
let age = 18   // --> so here we took a number/integer as its value 18
console.log(age) // here we printing its key(AGE).
console.log(typeof age) // here we are also printing the type of the age which is number
let updatedAge = String(age) // here we are updatig the value from number to string 
console.log(updatedAge) // here the upadated value is also 18. but this time its string istead of integer 
console.log(typeof updatedAge) // here we are printing the type of updated type of the age which is now string


/* CONVERTING THE NUMBER/STRING TO BOLLEAN */
let boolType = 0 // boolType = "Apple" /* here we are taking the boolType = 0 = False or boolType = "Apple" = True */
console.log(boolType) // here we. are printing the value of booltype which is 0 for now
console.log(typeof boolType) // here we are printing its type 
let UpdatedType = Boolean(boolType) // after that so in this line we are changing the previous type to bool type. 
console.log(UpdatedType) //. here we are printing the updated value 
console.log(typeof UpdatedType) // at last we. are checking the type of updatedType.


/* SO THIS IS MY COMMAND RESULT: num to string
18 --> assign 
number --> type
18 --> changed from number to string
string --> now its string 
_____________________________________________________
num/string to boolean
0 --> assign a value
number --> type 
false --> changed from number to boolean
boolean --> now its boolean
