so today i learnt about datatypes and conversion of datatypes. here's the code snippet:
DATA TYPES:
___________________________________________________________________________
// so today its time for datatypes and lemme tell you what i learnt today.

let myName = "Sajan" // --> this is String type
let age = 18 // --> this is [INT]eger type
let islogged = true // --> this is Bollean type means it holds only true or false
let obj = null // --> this is Null type mean its standalone object
let und; // its undefined like we ourself havent put any sort of thing so if we put "" then i can be string.

console.table([myName, age, islogged, obj, und])


//  SO AFTER RUNNING THE COMMAND IN. TERMINAL WE GOT THIS.
// the command is ----> node 01_basics/02_dataTypes
/*
┌─────────┬───────────┐
│ (index) │ Values    │
├─────────┼───────────┤
│ 0       │ 'Sajan'   │ --> String
│ 1       │ 18        │ --> Integer [Int]
│ 2       │ true      │ --> Bollean
│ 3       │ null      │ --> Null
│ 4       │ undefined │ --> Undefined
└─────────┴───────────┘

DATA TYPES CONVERSIONS:
// so lemme show you how to do dataypes conversion in javascript. 
// so we'll assign the value to with any data 



/*  CONVERTING THE NUMBER/INTERGER TO STRING */
let age = 18   // --> so here we took a number/integer as its value 18
console.log(age) // here we printing its key(AGE).
console.log(typeof age) // here we are also printing the type of the age which is number
let updatedAge = String(age) // here we are updatig the value from number to string 
console.log(updatedAge) // here the upadated value is also 18. but this time its string istead of integer 
console.log(typeof updatedAge) // here we are printing the type of updated type of the age which is now string


/* CONVERTING THE NUMBER/STRING TO BOLLEAN */
let boolType = 0 // boolType = "Apple" /* here we are taking the boolType = 0 = False or boolType = "Apple" = True */
console.log(boolType) // here we. are printing the value of booltype which is 0 for now
console.log(typeof boolType) // here we are printing its type 
let UpdatedType = Boolean(boolType) // after that so in this line we are changing the previous type to bool type. 
console.log(UpdatedType) //. here we are printing the updated value 
console.log(typeof UpdatedType) // at last we. are checking the type of updatedType.


/* SO THIS IS MY COMMAND RESULT: num to string
18 --> assign 
number --> type
18 --> changed from number to string
string --> now its string 
_____________________________________________________
num/string to boolean
0 --> assign a value
number --> type 
false --> changed from number to boolean
boolean --> now its boolean
